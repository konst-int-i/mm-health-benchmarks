    "Description: \n",
    "TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) thresholded gene-level copy number variation (CNV) estimated using the GISTIC2 method. Copy number profile was measured experimentally using whole genome microarray at a TCGA genome characterization center. Subsequently, GISTIC2 method was applied using the TCGA FIREHOSE pipeline to produce gene-level copy number estimates. GISTIC2 further thresholded the estimated values to -2,-1,0,1,2, representing homozygous deletion, single copy deletion, diploid normal copy, low-level copy number amplification, or high-level copy number amplification. Genes are mapped onto the human genome coordinates using UCSC xena HUGO probeMap. Reference to GISTIC2 method PMID:21527027.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gisctic2.0 thresholded CNV meanings: \n",
    "* -2: Homozygous deletion. Both copies of the gene are deleted, which can lead to the loss of tumor suppressor gene function.\n",
    "* -1: Single copy deletion. One copy of the gene is deleted, which might reduce the gene's function and could be significant if it's a tumor suppressor gene.\n",
    "* 0: Neutral / No change. The gene has the expected number of copies, suggesting it might not be involved in the cancer process for this patient.\n",
    "* 1: Low-level amplification. There is a slight increase in the number of copies of the gene, which could enhance the gene's function, potentially significant if the gene is an oncogene.\n",
    "* 2: High-level amplification. There is a significant increase in the number of copies of the gene, strongly suggesting the gene's enhanced function could be driving the cancer process."
